# 1942 Game
Inspired by the retro vertical scrolling 1942 shooter game using JavaFX. Players use the mouse to control the plane as it shoots incoming enemy planes using the spacebar. If enemy planes manage to slip through the player's line of fire they lose one health and if all health is lost, or they collide with an enemy plane they die and lose one of their total 3 lives. As time goes the game get progressively harder and the planes gain more health and fly faster.
